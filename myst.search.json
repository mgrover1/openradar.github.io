This knowledge and expertise will now be bundled in the \n\nopenradar discourse discussion platform in the future. The free plan of Discourse gives us the necessary jump start to achieve this goal. We are very pleased and grateful to be part of the \n\nfree discourse community.\n\nIn openradar discourse all things related to weather radar in the broadest sense and open source software in the narrowest sense can be discussed.
